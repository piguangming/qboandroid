I belong to that generation who grew up devouring science fiction novels which promised us that by the year 2000 we would spend the holidays in other planets, we would go to work on self-propelled airships and we would have a small fleet of robots at home. I spent my childhood dreaming of that wonderful future that they had projected in my mind, too late to stop my imagination, and I grew up with the disappointment of all those broken promises. It wasnâ€™t until a few years ago that I thought it would be feasible to take this small step to bring my dreams closer to reality, and build my own domestic robot.


Objective, Concept, Vision and Open Source

This project was conceived with the firm intention of creating a platform of Artificial Intelligence that could become a little bit smarter each day.

To achieve this, there are two lines of work that I consider essential: on the one hand, developing a robotic platform as standard as possible, that encourages the creation of an ecosystem of research and development around it. On the other hand, achieving a design that is attractive enough for people to emphasize with the platform and adopt it in their daily lives, feeding the ecosystem with their interactions.


Design + Linux + Arduino + ROS + Standards + Android + Cloud = Jiadu Robot
